mytag: Python music tagger and file organiser
---------------------------------------------
v1.2 - 14122012

Why do this?
------------
tagtool doesn't cut it and neither does any other music tagging program; so I made a GTK3 ID3v2.4 compatible replacement.


About
-----
This is a program to bring all the requirements of managing music files together into one program.
I have written a lot of music and file organisation programs for myself and the major software in this area just doesn't fit my needs.


Features other taggers don't have
---------------------------------
 * Fast and simple file tagging process
 * set tags and organise files according to their tag in a fast and easy way.


Recent Updates
--------------
 * Added ctrl + s/l/b/h shortcuts
 * Automatically tick checkboxes when typing in tag fields
 * Added backspace to folder navigation (go back one folder)
 * Corrected threading for GTK3 programs
 * UI and code structure updates


Supported output variables
--------------------------
%title% - Track title
%artist% - Track artist
%albumartist% - Album artist
%album% - Album title
%year% - Album release year
%disc% - Disc number
%track% - Track number
%genre% - Track Genre
%comment% - Track Comment

*NOTE: %albumartist% will fall back to artist when not available.
       This has been the best way I've found to manage multiple
       artist CD's/


Organisation example
--------------------
 * Output Style: %albumartist%/%year% %album%/%disc%-%track% - %title%
 * Input: /music/new/spawn soundtrack/01 - filter & the crystal method - trip like i do.mp3

No album artist set:
 * Output: /music/Filter & the Crystal Method/1997 Spawn/1-01 - Can't You (Trip Like I Do).mp3
Set Album Artist to 'Various':
 * Output: /music/Various/1997 Spawn/1-01 - Can't You (Trip Like I Do).mp3
